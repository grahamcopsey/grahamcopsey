                                <p><strong>Graham Copsey</strong> is an award winning artist who works across various digital and print mediums to bring you cutting edge designs. He graduated from London Art College and opened up his own digital media company known as “Graham Copsey Design Services”. He has worked with large brands and fortune 500 companies and has been involved in several high profile projects from inception to delivery.</p> 
								
								<p>Graham made a name for himself with his vibrant style which incorporates traditional design principles with a high tech twist. His art work is very distinctive and is commonly known as the Copsey effect. He uses colour and shapes to convey his unique style.</p>
								
								<p>Graham is commonly known as the "brand generator" where he is renowned for completely re-energising dull and lifeless brands and online social properties. His work with social media re-branding commonly results in a massive increase in social engagement and the massive reduction of visitor bounce rates.
								His speciality in the brand re-design space is focussed on Facebook where his unique touch is very effective even under the tight restrictions imposed by Facebook and social media properties.</p>
								
								<p>His artistic expression does not stop at the digital landscape as he has been involved in the production of various offline artistic pieces including a limited edition textile print which was used to produce a range of high end curtains and rugs as part of a local contemporary art exhibition. Graham, whose work was showcased at the exhibition won numerous awards for his contributions.</p>
								
								<p>Graham is also well known for his traditional print services including magazine and business card design. His sometimes controversial print design work is never dull and is always thought provoking.</p> 
								
								<p>Graham is always looking for new opportunities to make his distinctive mark and is open to queries regarding logo design, re-branding, web design, print design, photography and digital prints. The rates for such services are very competitive and can be delivered to required timescales.</p>
								
								<p>If you would like to book the services of Graham Copsey then you should send your requirements, conceptual ideas and colour schemes to Graham.Copsey@gmail.com. You should then receive a detailed quote and some conceptual ideas.</p>
								
								<p>From there we will then go through an iterative process to fine tune and refine your idea and deliver a bold and stunning design for your required medium. Studies show a brand or logo can increase your online authority which instils confidence in the visitor to trust your product or company. This trust has been proven to increase sales and visitor engagement.</p> 
								
								<p>If you are looking for any recommendations or testimonials for any of Graham’s previous work then get in touch and we will provide the contact details for you to check out. All of our clients are real clients with real projects and will have no problem in recommending Graham for any of your design work.</p>
